## Software to Install ( node, truffle etc. )

1. npm
Download and install `node.js`
from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. truffle
You should be able to [https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation):
```
	npm install -g truffle
```

3. ganache
```
	npm install -g ganache-cli
```

4. solc (solidity)

Just for entertainment there is a 'solc' compiler and a 'solc-js' compiler.  The 'solc-js' compile 
has different options.  We will want to use the 'solc' compiler.

On Windows the general consensus is to setup the Linux Subsystem for Windows.
[https://medium.com/@m_mcclarty/setting-up-solidity-on-windows-10-993a1d2c615c](https://medium.com/@m_mcclarty/setting-up-solidity-on-windows-10-993a1d2c615c)

### Or for Windows
[https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases)

Download the Windows binary from [https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases)

Extract the `solidity-windows.zip` into a new folder.

Launch a command prompt and cd into the directory where `solc.exe` was extracted to.

Move `solc.exe` to a suitable directory to run it form.  Usually I have a `bin` directory in my loign home with 
a path set in the environment that includes `bin`.



### On Mac
```
	brew update
	brew upgrade
	brew tap ethereum/ethereum
	brew install solidity
```

Given an Account and a Private key you can generate a "keyfile".

This will be the basis of Homework 5 ( 100 pts - install and setup truffle ).
Due at the end of spring break.  Homework 5 - is what you will need to build
smart contracts for Ethereum.


## Get some "fake" Ether

Go and get some fake ether:

[https://faucet.rinkeby.io/](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)

Your KEY: I will email each of you a password and key file.  Never Never Never use
this for real money (Eth or other)!

For Example: [https://twitter.com/pschlump/status/1119343603078193152](https://twitter.com/pschlump/status/1119343603078193152)

You put in the URL with the 0xXXXX....XXX address and it will send you funds.

## Setup example contract


Download and Setup an example set of contracts.

```sh
	$ mkdir MetaCoin
	$ cd MetaCoin
	$ truffle unbox metacoin
```


Output will be (should be):

```
Downloading...
Unpacking...
Setting up...
Unbox successful. Sweet!

Commands:

  Compile contracts: truffle compile
  Migrate contracts: truffle migrate
  Test contracts:    truffle test
```

You should have a directory tree that looks like:

```
.
├── LICENSE
├── contracts
│   ├── ConvertLib.sol
│   ├── MetaCoin.sol
│   └── Migrations.sol
├── migrations
│   ├── 1_initial_migration.js
│   └── 2_deploy_contracts.js
├── test
│   ├── TestMetacoin.sol
│   └── metacoin.js
└── truffle-config.js
```

Now you should be able to test the contracts you have downloadd with:

```sh
	$ truffle test
```

And the output should be:

```

Compiling ./contracts/ConvertLib.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/MetaCoin.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...
Compiling ./test/TestMetacoin.sol...
Compiling truffle/Assert.sol...
Compiling truffle/DeployedAddresses.sol...


  TestMetacoin
    ✓ testInitialBalanceUsingDeployedContract (92ms)
    ✓ testInitialBalanceWithNewMetaCoin (177ms)

  Contract: MetaCoin
    ✓ should put 10000 MetaCoin in the first account
    ✓ should call a function that depends on a linked library (39ms)
    ✓ should send coin correctly (163ms)


  5 passing (1s)

```


Now install Open Zeppelin 

```sh
	$ npm install openzeppelin-solidity
```
