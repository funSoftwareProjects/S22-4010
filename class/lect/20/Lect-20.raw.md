### Simple777Token Ours derived from ERC777

The ERC777 is a modern upgrade (and backward compatible) version of the ERC20 fungible token contract.
It improves on ERC20 with a pair of hooks, tokensToSend and tokensReceived that address a number of 
concurrency problems in token transfer.  It maintains compatibility with the above set of interfaces
for the ERC20 contract.

Let's take a look at the derived contract.

```

We are going to use the solc 8.1 compiler.  To do this we need

1. A current install of openzeppelin
```
$ npm install @openzeppelin/contracts 
```
2. Force truffle to use the 8.1 version of the solc compiler.
```
  // Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200
      },
      version: "0.8.1",    // Fetch exact version from solc-bin (default: truffle's version)
      evmVersion: "petersburg"
    }
  },

```

The biggest (and most important) difference between ERC20 and ERC777 is the addition of _operators_.
The contract owner (operator) can authorize and revoke trusted entities - with the power to act on the
owners behalf.   The authorized entity can move tokens for all addresses.

`send` replaces `transfer` and `transferFrom`.

}
]]])
```



start with:
```
contract ERC777 is Context, IERC777, IERC20 {
```

The contract inherits from the IERC777 interface and the IERC20 interface.  This means that it will have to support both interfaces specifications.

Interfaces are defined in ERC1820 and require that contracts publish a standard interface specification to the interface registery.

The constructor
```
    constructor(
        string memory name_,
        string memory symbol_,
        address[] memory defaultOperators_
    ) {
        _name = name_;
        _symbol = symbol_;

        _defaultOperatorsArray = defaultOperators_;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < defaultOperators_.length; i++) {
            _defaultOperators[defaultOperators_[i]] = true;
        }

        // register interfaces
        _ERC1820_REGISTRY.setInterfaceImplementer(address(this), keccak256("ERC777Token"), address(this));
        _ERC1820_REGISTRY.setInterfaceImplementer(address(this), keccak256("ERC20Token"), address(this));
    }
```

Takes a list of defaultOperators that may be empty.

At the  bottom of the contract the gurantees of matching with the registry are setup.
The constructor will not succede if it fails to match the standard.

The symbol is a short name, `S7`, and the name is `Simple777Token`.

## Send

     * @param requireReceptionAck if true, contract recipients are required to implement ERC777TokensRecipient
     */
    function _send(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory userData,
        bytes memory operatorData,
        bool requireReceptionAck
    ) internal virtual {
        require(from != address(0), "ERC777: send from the zero address");
        require(to != address(0), "ERC777: send to the zero address");

        address operator = _msgSender();

        _callTokensToSend(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);

        _move(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);

        _callTokensReceived(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData, requireReceptionAck);
    }
```

Send has basic checks that you are not sending to or receiving from a 0 address.

It calls the before hook, moves the tokens, then calls the after hook.
The work is in the `_move` call.


```
    function _move(
        address operator,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory userData,
        bytes memory operatorData
    ) private {
        _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, from, to, amount);

        uint256 fromBalance = _balances[from];
        require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC777: transfer amount exceeds balance");
        unchecked {
            _balances[from] = fromBalance - amount;
        }
        _balances[to] += amount;

        emit Sent(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```

An overidable function `_beforeTokenTransfer` is called.  You can replace this in the derived 
contract.

It then checks the balance of the sender - that they have enough to send.

`unchecked` is a substraction without overflow chekcing.   We have already done the check.
The funds are moved.

Then it emits 2 events.  Transfer matches with the ERC20 transfer event.    Sent is a new
event with ERC777.




<div class="pagebreak"></div>

## Send Hook

```
    /**
     * @dev Call from.tokensToSend() if the interface is registered
     * @param operator address operator requesting the transfer
     * @param from address token holder address
     * @param to address recipient address
     * @param amount uint256 amount of tokens to transfer
     * @param userData bytes extra information provided by the token holder (if any)
     * @param operatorData bytes extra information provided by the operator (if any)
     */
    function _callTokensToSend(
        address operator,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory userData,
        bytes memory operatorData
    ) private {
        address implementer = _ERC1820_REGISTRY.getInterfaceImplementer(from, _TOKENS_SENDER_INTERFACE_HASH);
        if (implementer != address(0)) {
            IERC777Sender(implementer).tokensToSend(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);
        }
    }
```

From the IERC777Sender interface specification:

```
interface IERC777Sender {
    /**
     * @dev Called by an {IERC777} token contract whenever a registered holder's
     * (`from`) tokens are about to be moved or destroyed. The type of operation
     * is conveyed by `to` being the zero address or not.
     *
     * This call occurs _before_ the token contract's state is updated, so
     * {IERC777-balanceOf}, etc., can be used to query the pre-operation state.
     *
     * This function may revert to prevent the operation from being executed.
     */
    function tokensToSend(
        address operator,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata userData,
        bytes calldata operatorData
    ) external;
}
```

This looks in the sender to see if they have implemented this interface.  If they have then
the function is called.  If the function fails it will revert the transaction.

The sender can perform tasks like lookup to see if this is a valid operation.

## Receive Hook


```
    /**
     * @dev Call to.tokensReceived() if the interface is registered. Reverts if the recipient is a contract but
     * tokensReceived() was not registered for the recipient
     * @param operator address operator requesting the transfer
     * @param from address token holder address
     * @param to address recipient address
     * @param amount uint256 amount of tokens to transfer
     * @param userData bytes extra information provided by the token holder (if any)
     * @param operatorData bytes extra information provided by the operator (if any)
     * @param requireReceptionAck if true, contract recipients are required to implement ERC777TokensRecipient
     */
    function _callTokensReceived(
        address operator,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory userData,
        bytes memory operatorData,
        bool requireReceptionAck
    ) private {
        address implementer = _ERC1820_REGISTRY.getInterfaceImplementer(to, _TOKENS_RECIPIENT_INTERFACE_HASH);
        if (implementer != address(0)) {
            IERC777Recipient(implementer).tokensReceived(operator, from, to, amount, userData, operatorData);
        } else if (requireReceptionAck) {
            require(!to.isContract(), "ERC777: token recipient contract has no implementer for ERC777TokensRecipient");
        }
    }
```

And the interface that can be implemented to receive tokens:

```
interface IERC777Recipient {
    /**
     * @dev Called by an {IERC777} token contract whenever tokens are being
     * moved or created into a registered account (`to`). The type of operation
     * is conveyed by `from` being the zero address or not.
     *
     * This call occurs _after_ the token contract's state is updated, so
     * {IERC777-balanceOf}, etc., can be used to query the post-operation state.
     *
     * This function may revert to prevent the operation from being executed.
     */
    function tokensReceived(
        address operator,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata userData,
        bytes calldata operatorData
    ) external;
}
```

This allows for things like notification of a receiver and for blocking receipt of tokens.



<div class="pagebreak"></div>

## Mint

```
    function _mint(
        address account,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory userData,
        bytes memory operatorData,
        bool requireReceptionAck
    ) internal virtual {
        require(account != address(0), "ERC777: mint to the zero address");

        address operator = _msgSender();

        _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), account, amount);

        // Update state variables
        _totalSupply += amount;
        _balances[account] += amount;

        _callTokensReceived(operator, address(0), account, amount, userData, operatorData, requireReceptionAck);

        emit Minted(operator, account, amount, userData, operatorData);
        emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount);
    }

```

This is the heart of the process.

Note that this is an `interal virtual` - this means that you can override the mint process with your own function
if you need to.

The receiver of the minted tokens gets notified that they have recived them.  This is called from the
constructor but can also be called from a 'mint' function if that is to be a part of your allowed 
behavior.

You can create:
```
    function mint(
        address account,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory userData,
        bytes memory operatorData
    ) public onlyOwner {
```
for example and only allow the owner to mint or use corresponding security to allow all authorized
users to mint - or only a set of "minters".

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

## Burn

```
    /**
     * @dev Burn tokens
     * @param from address token holder address
     * @param amount uint256 amount of tokens to burn
     * @param data bytes extra information provided by the token holder
     * @param operatorData bytes extra information provided by the operator (if any)
     */
    function _burn(
        address from,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory data,
        bytes memory operatorData
    ) internal virtual {
        require(from != address(0), "ERC777: burn from the zero address");

        address operator = _msgSender();

        _callTokensToSend(operator, from, address(0), amount, data, operatorData);

        _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, from, address(0), amount);

        // Update state variables
        uint256 fromBalance = _balances[from];
        require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC777: burn amount exceeds balance");
        unchecked {
            _balances[from] = fromBalance - amount;
        }
        _totalSupply -= amount;

        emit Burned(operator, from, amount, data, operatorData);
        emit Transfer(from, address(0), amount);
    }

```

This should look familiar.  This is the inverse operation of mint.

There are already  operatorSend and operatorBurn functions.
