# Assignment 06 - An Up Upgradable Voting Contract

Create a proxy contract (basically copy the example from lecture 29)
and then create a version 1 of a voting contract. 

Test the voting contract both directly - and through the proxy.

Now upgrade the voting contract to a version 2.   

Test the new version 2 of the contract both - directly calling it
and through the proxy.

The voting contract must have an empty constructor and an "initialize"
function that can be called to setup the contract.   Your migration
file must call the "initialize" function.


Version 1 of the voting contract - methods are:

Version 2 of the voting contract - methods are the same but
the votes are weighted by the number of tokens that the
user has.
